# rl-optimize

The main objective of this repository is to research and develop optimization problem (such as TSP, VRP, MIP etc.) solvers based on recent ML and RL introductions to this field. 

Our current works are very limited to a bunch of specific problem solvers and we will focus on building ML models or a single model if possible to solve all types of optimization problems.

The true nature of this repository will be providing high quality open source implementations but at the same time will also be kept private partially of under-development works.

# Contributors

We are actively searching for researchers and contributors who can help us building this open source library and will be joining the team to serve human being with advanced ML based optimization solutions.
